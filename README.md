# Introduction

This tool is designed to enhance labeling tasks in general, and streamline the workflow on the labelme platform in particular, making the process faster and more efficient. It leverages Python libraries such as keyboard and pyautogui for actions like pointing, renaming labels, drawing boxes, deleting, and handling key movements.

Special thanks to Duong, Tu, and friends for their support and contributions in developing and refining this tool. (Even though, admittedly, I relied on it so much that I lost track of my KPIs!)

# HOW TO USE

- You can clone this repository or download the .exe file directly for convenience.
